CARDS:

gain % of money

put <x> into card. card balance gains y% per turn. when card is used up, receive total balance. 

double effect of next card bought

double effect of next card used

double duration of all active effects


TODO
the positional thing of each card needs to be tied to card_class ? I don't know what this means.

weird css thing of cards moving down randomly as the game progresses
too many play all cards at the same time.
